# Vertical-Stacking
This repository contains the mechanical designs for vertical stacking of two quadrotor UAVs.
The CAD models named "docking_mechanism_1" and "docking_mechanism_2" are respectively the representation of how the mechanism would look like when placed on the quadrotor.
"M1" represents mechanism 1 and "M2" represents mechanism 2
